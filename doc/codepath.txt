Introduction *codepath-introduction*

codepath.vim is a plugin that provides a simple function to obtain your code
path directory if you have one. The concept is simple: I have a dir located
in $HOME/code where i store all my projects and I want to set current project
directory as root directory for plug-in like NERDTree and FuzzyFinderTextMate.
To explain what I mean, please consider the following examples:

    File Opened                                    CodePath() Result
1. <codepath>/awesome-project/foo.rb         ->    <codepath>/awesome-project
2. <codepath>/code/super-project/foo/bar.rb  ->    <codepath>/super-project
3. /any/path/but/not/code/foo.rb             ->    /any/path/but/not/code

So, the CodePath Function returns the "project" root if you open a file in any 
subdirectory of your codepath and the directory itself if you open a file in
any other location.

Configuration *codepath-configuration* *g:codepath*

The only configuration available now is the codepath directory location. You
can set it in the following way:

let g:codepath = "/your/dir"

If you don't set g:codepath the codepath.vim will consider $HOME/code as your
codepath directory.
