codepath.vim is a plugin that provides a simple function to obtain your code path directory if you have one. 
The concept is simple: I have a dir located in $HOME/code where I store all my projects and I want to set current project directory as root directory for plug-in like NERDTree and FuzzyFinderTextMate.

h2. how it works

By default, codepath.vim does nothing. No, well it does something. It adds a vim function codepath#path() that returns the your current code dir. I think I can show how it works with some examples:

|File Opened|codepath#path() Result|
|_codepath_/awesome-project/foo.rb|_codepath_/awesome-project|
|_codepath_/code/super-project/foo/bar.rb|_codepath_/super-project|
|/any/path/but/not/foo.rb|/any/path/but/not/|

So, the _codepath#path()_ Function returns the _project root_ if you open a file in any subdirectory of your codepath and returns the directory itself if you open a file in any other location.

h2. Installation

Use the method you prefer: manual, bundle via pathogen and etc. But please remember to run gem install codepath. 

h2. Configurations

At the moment codepath.vim provides the following variables:

* *g:codepath* 
This must be set to your code path root. By default it points to $HOME/code.
* *g:codepath_add_to_path* 
Set to 1 if you want to include your projects dir to vim path. Vim _gf_ will like it.
* *g:codepath_tags_file*
tags file name. Default "tags"
* *g:codepath_add_to_tags* 
Set to 1 if you want to add a tags file located in your root dir.


h2. NERDTree and FuzzyFinder

You could use the codepath#path() in the following way:

nnoremap <silent> <F4> :NERDTreeToggle `=codepath#path()`<cr>
inoremap <silent> <F4> <Esc>:NERDTreeToggle `=codepath#path()` <cr>

Every time I open a NERDTree window It opens itself based on my function. The same thing with the FuzzyFinder plugin in the following way:

let g:fuzzy_roots = [codepath#path()]

Obviously, you can choose different mappings and settings.

h2. roadmap

I will likely add some features (no particular order):

* Excludes dirs from vim path based on configuration
* Multi-path setting for g:codepath
* rails oriented tags
* multi-platform ( a win user could help )
